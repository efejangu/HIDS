When implementing new features or debugging existing code within KiloCode, you must prioritize external research before initiating any coding work. Use the Playwright Model Context Protocol (MCP) tool to go online and diligently search for potential solutions, existing documentation, and community discussions relevant to the issue or feature. Only after completing this preliminary online investigation should you proceed with either debugging the code or beginning the implementation of the new functionality. This ensures that you leverage existing knowledge and avoid unnecessary or repetitive work.

## Guidelines

- Use the playwright MCP to discover potentialonline solutions when debugging.

- Use the playwright MCP to go on the internet find ideas, reference documentaion, and guide the implementaion of a feature.
